Wordle, built for the web using Reactjs!
Play it <a href="https://react-wordle-mwdev.web.app/" target="_blank">here</a>

Decided to use Vite for this project, and also took it upon myself to improve upon the original game.

This version of wordle can be played however many times you like, simply refresh the page and a new mystery word will be selected.

Accessibility!

Instead of only using color changes to indicate a letter's status, I incorporated font size changes to help people with visual issues discern between correct, almost correct, and wrong letters! It's explained in the collapsible rules.

The word bank consists of 3100 5-letter words, but it does NOT include every 5-letter word, so an alert will display if a word that you tried to guess can not be found in that word bank.

(My wife discovered the word "Toxin" is not part of it!)
